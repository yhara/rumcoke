Why RumCoke does not have List?

* It's a matter of choise. There is no technical reason it cannot have List.
* Just wanted to see a Lisp based on Array.
* JavaScript does not have List, so nor RumCoke.

Why RumCoke has Symbol in addition to String?

* In s-expression, a symbol denotes variable reference and a string denotes a value.
  To distinguish variable reference and string value, rum-expression must have Symbol too.
